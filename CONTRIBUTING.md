## How to contribute to DataStore

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/argentini/Argentini.DataStore/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/argentini/Argentini.DataStore/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. We fix what we can't see.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted. Instead, let us know about the cosmetic changes you'd like to make and we will handle the rest. This excludes code documentation, which **can** be a pull request.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the issues area.
* Once we've collected enough positive feedback about the change we will evaluate the viability of the request.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use DataStore on [github issues](https://github.com/argentini/Argentini.DataStore/issues).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the DataStore documentation?**
